I cloned Calebâ€™s repository and found no errors upon compilation. After running the program and testing it, I encountered no errors. When I looked at the code, I found that it was well-documented and easily readable. 

One thing that Caleb did differently was having a details form to simplify data entry. However, I would like for it to open to the selected record instead of the first one in the table.
