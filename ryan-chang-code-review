After cloning and running the Windows Form application I found no errors upon compliation of the application. However I did run into a couple of errors on the CityDetailsForm part of the application. 
Whenever I clicked on the Show Details button it automatically shows the details of the City with the ID of 1. I think it would be nice from a user point of view whenever Show Details is cilcked that it shows the details of the city that is currently being clicked on the main report from the home page.
I do also get an error whenever I try to use the top arrow buttons on the top of the screen to try and show details for another city whenever I make an edit to one of the text fields. I think that if something is changed there may need to be a way to stop users from clicking the arrows. However if there is nothing that has been edited
then the application does work as intended. Overall this application works great and is very easy to understand. 
Taking a look into the backend of the application I feel like the code is very well written and there isn't really any rendunancies. Overall a very very good job!
