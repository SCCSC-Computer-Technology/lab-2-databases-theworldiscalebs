Caleb’s Form design of the database has 8 buttons that connects the database of:
•	Show Details
•	ASC Population
•	DESC Population
•	Sort by City
•	Total Population of all Cities
•	Average Population of all Cities
•	Highest Population of all Cities
•	Lowest Population of all Cities
Then you have your “Exit” button underneath the rest. However, the text of “City Population” has an extra “o” in “Population”. 
File name was partially met titling, “ThompsonCPT206DatabaseLab2”; which I greatly appreciate the separation title assignments. 
However, it should have been titiled “CThompson-Lab-2” like the course addendum showed at the very last page when submitting the assignment [highlighted in yellow].

The code, inside the Form design, is neat with variables being with the assigned buttons, some show a message box for certain buttons, and comments 
about what each button is used for is shown. To the second part is the “CityDetails”, the code form includes an “Exit” button but no comment is shown for the 
purpose for it. The design, of “CityDetails”, shows a short window form with four labels and four textboxes across from the labels and an “Exit” button underneath them.

Upon running the programming every single button work amazing, I especially like the “highest” and “lowest” buttons because not only it shows the highest and lowest 
numbers but, also shows which city and/or specifically has the highest or lowest. Additionally, once I clicked on the “Exit” button 
the message said “Thank you for using the population program database have a good day :)”. [Add 1 point for additional message]

Overall, the program of my fellow classmate Caleb Thompson shows a complete assignment with a smooth transition of two Windows forms of the database 
with one holding the database while the details form holds the details from the database itself. Comparing his program to mine shows that I still need to learn 
and also remove extra, accidentally databases in my program and need to add an “Exit” button on my “Details” window. Additionally, showed me to not panic so 
quickly to submit quickly; starting ahead would be wise when doing the assignment on my part.
