Overall the code looks great. I could follow along very easily, and knew what you was doing on every line. There were plenty of comments to let me know what was trying to be accomplished.
From what I could see there were no defects in your code. It looks like it would work perfectly fine.
There are a few differences in our code, but for the most part I think they were pretty similar.
The only thing I noticed was when you commented when you was setting the variable to hold the total, you said average instead of total. Other than that I think your code was great.
